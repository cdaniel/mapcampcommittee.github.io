  <p><strong>What is Map Camp?</strong> It started as a tweet from <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/swardley/status/827140829877850112">Simon Wardley</a> asking if anyone would like to have <em>"a small meetup in London on mapping"</em>. It had so much interest that it quickly turned into a full day event. Map Camp is a one day London based conference including workshops and talks about mapping techniques used in organisations.</p>
