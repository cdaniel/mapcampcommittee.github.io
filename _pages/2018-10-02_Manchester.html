<h2>Expression of Interest</h2>
<p>
Map-Camp Manchester/North is aiming to be a free to attend event for delegates.</p>

<p>So the organising team is looking at venue options, seeking event sponsors / underwriters (to cover event costs) and seeking additional volunteers and community members to get involved and also spread the word.</p>

<p>Potential delegates are requested to complete this Expression of Interest form, so that the organising team can get an understanding of whether there is sufficient interest in area/region to put Map-Camp Manchester/North on as an event.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/map-camp-manchesternorth-expression-of-interest-registration-42426294188" class="btn">I'm Interested!</a></p>

<p>Further details pending.</p>
